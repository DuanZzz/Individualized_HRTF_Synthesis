**Synthesis of individualized HRTFs based on Neural Networks, Principal Component Analysis and anthropometry.**


## General info 

This repository was developed as part of a bachelor thesis project for Acoustic Engineering @ Federal University of Santa Maria - Brazil.


## Individualized HRTF app 

MATLAB app that can be used to generate individualized HRTFs with SOFA or HeSuVi extensions, using the proposed model.


## Auraliza app

MATLAB app that can create real-time virtual auditory scenes using SOFA HRTFs and n-channel audio input.


## Main - (PCA based)

Contains the pre-processing and post-processing routines, regression model and HRTF reconstruction.


> *It may be necessary to ajust paths for your local directories.*


## Functions 

Toolbox to work with SOFA HRTFs and general functions used by the main routines.
